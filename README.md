# Caesar on Rails

This is a Rails application that I've created to encrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.
I did use Christine Yu's solution to the problem (https://github.com/cy/ruby_sandbox/blob/master/caesar_cipher.rb) for pointers but am not sure if the code I've used so far is similar enouh to warrant forking it.
