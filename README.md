# Caesar on Rails

This is a Rails application that I've created to encrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.
I did use Christine Yu's solution to the problem (https://github.com/cy/ruby_sandbox/blob/master/caesar_cipher.rb) for pointers but am not sure if the code I've used so far is similar enough to warrant forking it. My code takes into account case and punctuation when encrypting the message.
